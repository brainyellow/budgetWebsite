We are planning on creating a budgeting website for our database project. Our budgeting website would help individuals manage their finances. We believe this is an important topic because many Americans are in debt and may need assistance managing their money. They will be able to use our website to examine and track their expenses, and decide on different ways to better invest, save or allocate their wealth. Our website will calculate the user’s net salary after taxes and the amount of surplus left over after expenses.
 
Users will be able to set a Monthly or Yearly Budget. Depending on the user’s preference, they can set a timeframe for a budget, categorize expenses, and keep track of other finances such as savings for leisure, education, mortgages, investing, etc.
 
Users will also be able to set:
Budget Goals: Users can see their progress on how much money a user has allocated for something specific.
Saving Goals: Users can set goals to restrict excessive spending and track how much money they are saving on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.
Input from user:
•	Whether they want to calculate yearly or monthly
•	Gross salary (yearly/monthly)
•	State located (to determine tax info)
•	Approximate value of various expenses (rent, food, etc.)
•	Money spent on leisure’s
•	TBD
 
In our database, we are planning to store the various tax percentages such as federal tax, income tax, etc. for each state. For the income tax we will include the various levels of tax brackets. We feel like our website can easily surpass 50,000 unique entries because there are infinite combinations of an individual's salary, location, expenses, leisure’s, etc.
