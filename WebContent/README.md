## Project Proposal

We are planning on creating a budgeting website for our database project. Our budgeting website would help individuals manage their finances. Such individuals will be able to use our website to discover how much money they actually can save, and decide on different ways to better invest, save or allocate their wealth. Our website will calculate the userâ€™s net salary after taxes and necessary expenses.

#### Input from user:
- Gross salary 
- State located (to determine tax info)
- Approximate value of various expenses (rent, food, etc.)
 
In our database, we are planning to store the various tax percentages such as federal tax, income tax, etc. for each state. For the income tax we will include the various levels of tax brackets. We feel like our website can easily surpass 50,000 unique entries because there are infinite combinations of an individual's salary, location, expenses, etc.
